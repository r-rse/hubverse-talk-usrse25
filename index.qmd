# Background {.inverse}

::: notes
Hi everyone,

My name is Anna Krystalli.

I used to be an **RSE at the University of Sheffield** but a few years ago, I returned back home to Greece and **set up my own RSE company.**

Today I'm going to talk to you about the **hubverse**, a project I've been involved in since 2023.

And I'll start with some **motivating background on the project**
:::

## ❌ The problem

**Infectious disease modeling has scaled rapidly…**

-   But the landscape is fragmented:
    -   Inconsistent formats
    -   Redundant or conflicting forecasts
    -   Lack of coordination between modelers and stakeholders

> “Comparing the accuracy of forecasting applications is difficult because forecasting methods, forecast outcomes, and reported validation metrics varied widely.”
>
> -   [Chretien et al., PLOS ONE, 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094130)

::: notes
Over the past two decades, and especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, **infectious disease modeling has become a central tool in public health decision-making**.

We’ve seen an **explosion of forecasting efforts**.

This growth is **encouraging and reflects increased computational capacity**, **improved data availability**, and **global interest** in predictive analytics for public health.

However, it has also come with growing pains.

-   **Modeling efforts often develop independently**: each group uses its **own data structure** for model outputs, **metadata**, and **evaluation**, making **integration and comparison difficult.**

-   **Modelers and decision-makers don’t always communicate clearly**. model outputs **may not match what public health needs**.

    This results in **significant fragmentation** which **limits the collective utility of modeling efforts.** 
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✨ The promise of modeling hubs

**Modeling hubs** coordinate collaborative forecasting:

-   Provide **centralised location** for effort coordination

-   Define **data** **standards** and **modeling** **targets**

-   Improve **transparency** and **comparability**

-   Aggregate forecasts **enabling ensembles**

-   Facilitate timely **public health decision-making**

    \

> [***“Collaborative Hubs: Making the Most of Predictive Epidemic Modeling”***](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306831)***,** American Journal of Public Health Reich, et al. 2022*

::: notes
**Modeling hubs** which provide **centralized infrastructure** for **coordinating the modeling efforts** of multiple groups have been proposed as a solution:

-   Firstly Hubs **bring structure** and a standardised central location for collecting model outputs.

-   They **establish a shared modeling protocol**: what outcomes to forecast, for which locations and time horizons, in what format.

-   By enforcing **standards** and **submission rules**, hubs ensure that **forecasts can be examined and compared.**

-   Standardization also **allows for ensemble models that combine many forecasts**, often outperforming individual models, a major asset during uncertain conditions.

-   Hubs make it easier for stakeholders, from **local agencies** to **national institutions**, to **access timely, interpretable forecasts**.

Modeling hubs **transform isolated efforts** into **coordinated forecasting ecosystems**.

They aren’t just **data repositories**, they’re **collaborative infrastructures**.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🕰️ Project origins {.smaller}

-   **Pre-COVID:** Forecasting code base existed for CDC **influenza** hubs
-   **During COVID:** That code was reused for new **COVID-19** hubs + demand internationally (e.g. Europe) for similar setups
-   ❗ Problem: Each hub required **manual editing** of source code

**➡️ Need for generalisation, modularity, and configurability**

![Figure credits: Alex Vespignani and Nicole Samay](assets/images/hub-history.png){fig-alt="Timeline of forecasting hub development" fig-align="left" width="700"}

::: notes
Before COVID, the US CDC had **already established a foundation for collaborative infectious disease forecasting** through its **FluSight initiative**, focused on influenza.

This resulted in an **initial working codebase to support such efforts**.

During the pandemic, **interest in modeling hubs exploded** and this infrastructure was called on for repurposing:

• First by the **US CDC COVID-19 Forecast Hub**

• Then interest grew to **scenario modeling hubs**, as well as **internationally**.

**‼ BUT** to set up each new hub, **manual changes to the source code was required**, obviously not ideal.

This is what **motivated the development** of a more **configurable**, more **generalized** and more **modular** system to support **new infectious disease modeling hubs.**
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌐 Enter the **hubverse**

An open-source **software ecosystem** to power modeling hubs:

-   **Data standards** for infectious disease forecasting data
-   **Schema-driven configuratio**n for modeling tasks + hub setup
-   Modular tools for validation, access, evaluation, ensembling, communication and hub administration
-   **Supports full lifecycle:** from hub set up, data submission to decision-making

::: notes
... an **what lead to the creation of the hubverse**

\> which is an **open-source software ecosystem** designed **to support the full lifecycle of infectious disease modeling hubs**.

It brings together:

• **Standardised data formats** for infectious disease modeling.

• **Schema-driven configuration**, for defining a hub's modeling tasks, submission schedule, and other expectations.

• A **suite of tools** for hub **administration**, **data validation**, **access**, **evaluation**, **ensembling, visualisation** and **communication**.
:::

# Hubverse overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ☑️ Standardised Data

Modeling hubs are **built around a shared data standard:**

-   **Modeling task definition**: targets (response variables), standard predictors, output types (e.g. `mean`, `quantiles`)
-   **Structured hub layout**: consistent file system for organizing submissions
-   **Standard model output format**: for file content and naming

✅ Enables comparability, validation, and streamlined data access

::: notes
**At its core**, the hubverse represents a **shared data standard** for modeling hubs.\
Everything else **builds on that foundation.**

This covers how modeling task are defined:

-   what’s being predicted,

-   which predictors are to be used,

-   and what output types are accepted.

Defining these up front in a standardised way **removes ambiguity** and **ensures every team is working to the same specification.**

Model outputs are submitted within a **structured hub layout**, so **files** are always stored in **predictable** **standard locations.**

Finally, the **model output files themselves** follow a consistent format and naming convention.

Together, **these standards** make **model outputs directly comparable** and **easy to combine in downstream analysis**.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙️ Config-driven hub setup

**Hub administrators configure hubs using structured JSON config files:**

-   `admin.json`: hub-level metadata.
-   `task.json`: modeling task specification:
    -   **Task IDs**: Targets (response), horizons, locations (predictors) etc.
    -   **Output types**: accepted model outputs e.g. `mean`, `median`, `quantiles`, `cdf`, `pmf`, `samples`.
-   Configs are validated against a shared JSON [**schema**](https://github.com/hubverse-org/schemas)

::: notes
A key feature of the hubverse is that **hub setup is configuration-based**.

Administrators define the **hub's goals** and **expectations** through **structured JSON config files**:

-   **`admin.json`** describes **hub-level** properties like hub name, maintainers, timezone, allowed data formats etc.\
-   **`task.json`** defines the **modeling tasks**:
    -   what targets (response variable),
    -   what predictor variables (other task IDs),
    -    and which output types are accepted for a given modeling task.

Config files are **validated** against a **JSON schema** and are used for **validating submissions**.

The result is that **new hubs can be spun up quickly** and **modeling tasks are clearly and unambiguously defined** from the start.

This enables **clear communication of tasks by administrators** **ensuring modeling efforts are policy relevant.**

:::: notes
::: notes
Let me now **introduce the core hubverse packages** that support our **modeling hub infrastructure.**

We’ve intentionally organized the ecosystem by **user role**. That’s because a **modeling hub isn’t a single-user platform**, it involves **multiple roles**, each with distinct **responsibilities**, **technical skills**, and **needs**.

On the **left**, we show the primary roles:

-   **Hub administrators** are responsible for setting up and maintaining the hub’s infrastructure and configuration.
-   **Modelers** focus on submitting model outputs via pull requests.
-   **Analysts** need to **explore**, **combine**, and **evaluate** forecast data, often across many models and time points.
-   **Policy makers** or Public health officials typically need **high-level summaries**, **dashboards**, and **access to curated insights**, not raw files.

On the **right**, we map each of these user groups to the packages that support their work:

-   `hubAdmin` helps **administrators** create and validate the structure of their configuration files.
-   `hubValidations` is the gatekeeper, enforcing the standards set by the admins by validating every PR, ensuring files are named, structured, and formatted correctly. Can also be used by modelers prior to submitting.
-   `hubData` (available in both R and Python) gives **analysts** and **modelers** an easy way to **directly access multi-file** model outputs directly as Arrow datasets.
-   `hubEvals` **supports** model evaluation.
-   `hubEnsembles` provides **functions for combining** model outputs into ensembles.
-   `hubVis` supports model output and ensemble visualisations.
:::
::::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Dashboards & communication

-   Built with [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org) so easily customisable via Quarto configuration
-   Deployed as a **fully static site** , no backend required
-   Powered by JSON data prepared via GitHub workflows
-   Interactive UI built with client-side JavaScript (fast!)
-   New instances can be set up by copying/configuring the [`hub-dashboard-template`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hub-dashboard-template)

::: notes
**Dashboards are crucial for communicating** model outputs to a broader audience, including **policy makers, public health officials, and even the general public** so we put effort into developing a plug and play dashboard template.

-   Our template is built in **Quarto**, so it’s easy to customise and extend.

-   What makes it powerful is that it's **fully static**, no backend needed.\
    JSON data are generated from hub data by **GitHub workflows**, and the JavaScript frontend fetches this data to create a dynamic, interactive experience for the user.

This design makes it **fast**, **easy to host** (e.g. on GitHub Pages), and **simple to replicate**.

Hub admins can **launch new dashboards quickly** by **copying** and **configuring** the [`hub-dashboard-template`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hub-dashboard-template).
:::

## ☁️ Cloud hub storage and access

-   Hubs mirrored to public AWS S3 buckets
-   Data can be opened as Arrow datasets
-   Enables queryable data access via R 📦 `hubData` and Python 📦 `hubdata`.

::: notes
As a bonus, we've developed infrastructure to mirror validated hub data to **AWS S3 buckets**, making it publicly accessible as an **Arrow dataset**.

This **enables downstream users**, especially **analysts**, to **query the data** without needing to clone the full repository.

\
They can **access** it via the **R** or **python equivalent package** `hubdata`.

This **cloud mirroring** service is something the **hubverse currently provides**.\
To enable it for a new hub:

-   The hub administration needs to **contact us** so we can provision a bucket.

-   They need to add a bit of **lightweight configuration** to their `admin.json` file to activate it and install the relevant action workflow.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔁 GitHub workflows

We automate everything we can:

-   ✅ PR-level model output validation
-   ✅ Hub configuration validation
-   ☁️ AWS Cloud hub data synching
-   📊 dashboard data regeneration and model evaludation with each update

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" icon="false"}
All hubverse actions stored in the [**`hubverse-actions`**](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubverse-actions) repo and can be installed with `hubCI::use_hub_github_action()`
:::

::: notes
**Automation is a cornerstone of the hubverse.**\
We use **GitHub Actions** to handle **hub operations**.

This includes:

-   Validating model output submissions and target data at the **pull request** level,

-   Validating **hub configuration files**,

-   Synchronising validated model output to **cloud storage**,

-   Generating dashboard data + computing model evaluation metrics.

All our workflows are stored in the [`hubverse-actions`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubverse-actions) repo.\
They're easy to adopt, hub administrators can install them using the `hubCI::use_hub_github_action()` helper.

This approach ensures **consistency**, and relatively **low overhead** for administrators.

```

::: notes
Now that we've **seen the infrastructure**, let’s **look at adoption**.

**This page** on our site **showcases** **hubs using the hubverse stack**, from long-standing hubs like the **Flusight Forecast Hub** to newer efforts like the COVID-19 Variant Nowcast or West Nile Virus hubs.

Each hub entry includes **structured metadata**: like a hub description, whether data are publicly available, and links to the relevant GitHub repos, dashboards and cloud storage.

This kind of **shared metadata and visibility** wouldn’t be possible without the consistency enforced by the hubverse framework.

It also serves as a **community resource**, a **growing catalog of open modeling hubs** that are easy to discover and learn from.

# 🦠 Real-world example: CDC FluSight Hub

::: notes

Now let's take a look at some this infrastrcuture in action by focusing on the CDC Flusight Hub

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Real-world example: [CDC FluSight Hub](https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub)

-   Used by US CDC to **monitor influenza severity**
-   **Weekly** forecasts from **40 teams** across **70 different models.**
-   Hosted on **GitHub + S3 cloud mirror**.
-   Managed using **full hubverse stack since 2023/2024 season**.
:::
:::::

::: notes
The **CDC FluSight Hub** is a flagship example of the hubverse stack in action.

It’s used by the **US CDC to monitor influenza severity** through **weekly model outputs**, submitted by over **40 teams**, spanning **70 different models**.

The hub is **fully managed** using the hubverse software, **workflows** and **S3 cloud mirroring** since the **2023/24 season**.

If we peek into the repository structure, you'll see the **key directories** that define a hub:

-   `hub-config`: holds the JSON config files.
-   `model-output`: where teams submit their model output files
-   `target-data`: stores the **observed data** used to **evaluate forecasts**, such as **reported influenza-like illness rates**.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📁 File structure: model output (CDC FluSight)

Model outputs committed by teams to versioned directories \> one directory per model \> one file per modeling round.

![](assets/images/flusight-model-outputs.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of flusight hub model output files" width="90%"}

::: notes
This slide breaks down a single model output file and it's location in the **CDC FluSight hub**.

On the top, we see the file lives under the `model-output/<model_id>` directory.

Files are named using a **round ID** and **model ID**, e.g., `2023-10-14-CADPH-FluCAT_Ensemble.csv`. Each **file contains all predictions** for **that round** by **that model.**

Inside the file:

\- The **Task ID columns**, like `target`, `horizon`, and `location` store information about individual predictions.

\- The **Output Type columns** describe the prediction format (e.g., quantiles).

\- And the `value` column holds the actual predicted values.

This file structure (task ids, output type, values) is fully standardised across all hubs.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✅ Model output validation with [`hubValidations`](https://hubverse-org.r-universe.dev/hubValidations)

Model outputs submitted through PRs and validated through GitHub Actions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](assets/images/ga-action-screenshot.png){fig-alt="screenshot of flusight hub model submission validation results"}
:::
:::::

::: notes
Every **model output** is **submitted via GitHub pull requests**, and **each submission** is validated using the `hubValidations` package.

On the left, we see the latest submissions from different teams for a specific forecast round.

On the right is an example validation log from GitHub Actions. Here, `hubValidations` checks that the submission:

-   Passes file level checks e.g.:

    -   Follows the required file structure,

    -   Is named and placed correctly,

-   And passes content-level checks:

    -   valid task ID and output type value combinations,

    -   required tasks submitted,

    -   valid output types - output type specific checks (e.g quantile crossing)

    -   Custom checks also supported

These **automated** checks **catch errors early** and **keep hub data clean** and **trustworthy.**
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📂 Accessing model output via [`hubData`](https://hubverse-org.r-universe.dev/hubData)

  ) |>
  collect_hub()
```
:::
:::::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
See more in [Accessing data vignette](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubData/articles/connect_hub.html).

Python analogue [**`hub-data`**](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hub-data) also available.
:::

::: notes
We've designed the hubverse format so that, while teams look after their own submission files, model outputs can be **accessed** as a **whole** as a **queryable Arrow dataset**.

Here we show **how to connect to the FluSight hub's S3 mirror using `hubData`**.

We can then filter and collect data using standard `dplyr` verbs.

This makes it easy for **analysts**, **modelers**, or **public** **health** **teams** to extract **relevant** **subsets** of data they need.

The same functionality is available in Python via the `hub-data` package.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌐 Ensembling with `hubEnsembles`

Combine models using simple or weighted rules

```{r}
forecast_df <- hub_con |>
  filter(
    model_id %in%
      c(
        "CADPH-FluCAT_Ensemble",
        "CEPH-Rtrend_fluH",
        "CFA_Pyrenew-Pyrenew_HE_Flu"
      ),
    output_type == "quantile"
  ) |>
  collect_hub()


hubEnsembles::simple_ensemble(forecast_df, model_id = "linear-pool-normal")
```

::: notes
**Ensembling is central to the hub idea** as it helps improve prediction robustness by combining multiple model predictions into a single output.

`hubEnsembles` provides a **simple interface** to build various types of ensembles from hubverse formatted data.

This example shows how to pull data from a few different models and apply a simple ensemble method.

## 📈 Dashboard - [forecasts](https://reichlab.io/flusight-dashboard/forecast.html?as_of=2025-05-31&interval=95%25&target_var=wk+inc+flu+hosp&xaxis_range=2023-09-01&xaxis_range=2025-07-01&yaxis_range=-3787.6522689994536&yaxis_range=57169.8764352105&model=FluSight-ensemble&model=FluSight-baseline&location=US)

![](assets/images/dashboard-forecasts.png)

::: notes
This is the FluSight dashboard and specifically the forecast page. 

It enables users to **explore predictions interactively**: you can choose **outcomes**, **forecast dates** and compare multiple models visually.

Crucially, the **dashboard also shows the target (observed) data alongside forecasts**, which helps **contextualise model behaviour** and **monitor real-world performance**.

**Clicking on any model name in the left-hand panel opens that model’s metadata page** , which includes details about the model, contributors, assumptions etc.
:::

## 🩺 Dashboard - [model evaluations](https://reichlab.io/flusight-dashboard/eval.html)

Evaluates forecasts against target (observed) data.

![](assets/images/dashboard-eval.png){width="90%"}

::: notes
This is the **evaluation tab** of the FluSight dashboard, which **helps users compare model performance** using **standard metrics**.

It’s **powered by the `hubEvals` package,** which **computes evaluation scores** by **comparing model outputs** to the **target data,** also stored in the hub.

The evaluation **supports scoring rules** such as:

-   **WIS** (**Weighted Interval Score**)

-   **MAE** (**Mean Absolute Error)**

-   **Coverage** of **50% and 95%** prediction intervals

Evaluations are **performed during the dashboard build** and are **summarised** into an **interactive table**, allowing for quick comparison across models.

:::
:::::

::: notes
To wrap up:

-   **Standards and automation reduce friction** at every level -**submitting**, **validating**, and **accessing** model outputs becomes much easier and more reliable.
-   **Open-source tooling** makes all this infrastructure freely accessible, which is **especially valuable** in **fast-moving** or **resource-constrained** public health contexts.
-   **Collaborative infrastructure** like this fosters **shared understanding** and **accountability**.
-   But beyond that, **making the data** openly available in a **standardised format** opens **doors to wider impact**. For example, hubverse data are already being **used in teaching**, like this SISMID course on **real-world outbreak forecast evaluation**, which builds directly on hubverse data and tools.

We hope this inspires other communities to adopt or adapt similar workflows.
